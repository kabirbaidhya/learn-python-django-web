In this tutorial we'll try to add hash tags and filters to the todoapp.

## Step by Step Instructions
 1. Ability to add hash tags in the todo form.
 2. Save hash tags in the database
 3. In the todo list display hash tags of each todo item in addition to the  title.
 4. Hash tags should be clickable and should link to filter items by that  tag.
 5. Filtered todo list
  - Should display "Filtered by: {hashtag}" in the top of the list
  - That list should only contain the items that has the hash tag.
  - Should also have a cross button at the right side to clear the filter.
 6. Ability to filter todo items by "Completed", "Not Completed (Pending)"  or All statuses.
