Django - Hello World
====================
[Home](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/learn-python-django-web) | [← Prev](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/learn-python-django-web/blob/master/units/django/1/wsgi-pip-and-virtualenv.md) | [Next →](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/learn-python-django-web/blob/master/units/django/3/templates-and-views.md)

In this session we're going to dive into the [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework and create our very first project using django.

Here we'll try to create a TodoApp. I hope by now you're pretty clear about the [basics](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/learn-python-django-web#python) and the concepts of [web](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/learn-python-django-web#web-development-basics), [wsgi and some pythonic tools](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/learn-python-django-web/blob/master/units/django/1/wsgi-pip-and-virtualenv.md) we've discussed in our [previous sessions](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/learn-python-django-web) so far, if not then you might want to check these links.

## TodoApp
Now let's start building our app.

### Setup virtualenv
Let's start by setting up `virtualenv` with Python 3+.

We'll create a virtualenv named `py3` under `envs` directory.
```bash
 ➜ mkdir ~/envs
 ➜ virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3 ~/envs/py3
```

Now activate it.
```bash
 ➜ source ~/envs/py3/bin/activate
```
You should now be able to see a virtualenv identifier `py3` near your prompt in the terminal like this:
```bash
(py3) 
[kabir@leapfrog] ~
 ➜ 
```

### Install django
Now it's time to install django. Install it using `pip`:
```bash
 ➜ pip install django
```

Test your installation
```bash
 ➜ django-admin --version
```

### Create a project
Now, let's go and create our very first project.
```bash
 ➜ django-admin startproject todoapp
```

You should be able to see that `todoapp` directory has been created with some boilerplate code already generated by `django-admin`. Open it using your favorite code editor and go through the code.

Folder structure should look similar to this:
```
todoapp
├─todoapp
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── manage.py
```

### Create new todos app
Now we need to create a new django app `todos`.
We can do this using:
```bash
 ➜ cd todoapp
 ➜ python manage.py startapp todos
```

Check the code again, you can see new directory `todos` has been created with some more code. Go through them too.

Now the new directory structure would look like:
```
todoapp
├── todoapp
│        ├── __init__.py
│        ├── settings.py
│        ├── urls.py
│        └── wsgi.py
├── todos
│        ├── __init__.py
│        ├── admin.py
│        ├── apps.py
│        ├── migrations
│        ├── models.py
│        ├── tests.py
│        └── views.py
└── manage.py
```

You now need to register this new app `todos` into our `todoapp` project.
Open `todoapp/settings.py` and append `todos` to `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'todos'
]
```

### Run the server
Let's run the development server now to test our very first app.
```bash
 ➜ python manage.py runserver
```
You would see server has started now.

```bash
 ➜ python manage.py runserver
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

You have 13 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

April 28, 2017 - 21:56:40
Django version 1.11, using settings 'todoapp.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
[28/Apr/2017 21:56:54] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1716
Not Found: /favicon.ico
[28/Apr/2017 21:56:54] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 1963
[28/Apr/2017 22:00:31] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1716
```
Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) you should be able to see our app is up and running.

But you may see some warnings shown on the page. This is because we still haven't run the database migrations yet.

### Migrations
Let's run the database migrations now. First you need to press `Ctrl + C` to end the server in your terminal.

Then you can run:
```bash
 ➜ python manage.py migrate
```

You should be able to see the migrations running.
```bash
 ➜ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
    Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
    Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
    Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
    Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
    Applying admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add... OK
    Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
    Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
    Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
    Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
    Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
    Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
    Applying auth.0007_alter_validators_add_error_messages... OK
    Applying auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length... OK
    Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
```

Now re-run our server using:
```bash
 ➜ python manage.py runserver
```
And go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) again, you can see the warnings are gone by now.

Great. You've just created your first app with django. Now let's change some code.
Check the full source code for the todoapp [here](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/django-todoapp).

## Exercises
 1. Create a bootstrap templates for the following pages:
    - Todo list
    - Add todo form
    - Edit todo form

## Next Step
In the [next tutorial](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/learn-python-django-web/blob/master/units/django/3/templates-and-views.md) we'll be working more with the templates and views to complete the UI of our application.
